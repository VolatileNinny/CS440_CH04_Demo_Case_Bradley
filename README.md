# CS440_CH04_Demo_Case_Bradley

I chose the MIT License simply because anything I would work on and post on Github would most likely be public and something I would be willing to share. The description Github gives says that is short and to the point and doesn't hold me liable for what other people use my code for. If for some reason I wanted to work on something like a proprietary license I might make a different repository in which I do not choose a license. In that, case the code would still be copyrighted but it would not give others permission to use my code.
